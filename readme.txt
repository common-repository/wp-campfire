Notify your coworkers about a new blog post through the Basecamp Campfire group-chat service.

This plugin requires cURL support on your WordPress server.

== Changelog ==

= 0.1.1 =
* Code formatting updates
* Updated compatability to WP 3.1.2

* Initial public release

== To-Do ==

Here are a few things I'd like to implement in upcoming versions:

* Ping the Campfire API to get a list of your allowed rooms and allow you to select the room's "nicename" via a dropdown instead of the Room ID.
* Add more text pattern variables.
